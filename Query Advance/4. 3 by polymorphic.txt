We can set up a polymorphic relationship between posts, comments, and replies. This will allow comments and their replies to be associated with posts through a single relationship. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Posts Table:**
   - `id`: Primary key for posts.
   - Other post-related columns like `title`, `content`, etc.

2. **Comments Table:**
   - `id`: Primary key for comments.
   - `content`: Content of the comment.
   - `commentable_id`: Foreign key referencing the `id` column in the related model (e.g., `posts` table).
   - `commentable_type`: String column storing the class name of the related model (`App\Models\Post`), indicating the type of the related model.

3. **Replies Table (Comments Table Structure):**
   - `id`: Primary key for replies.
   - `content`: Content of the reply.
   - `commentable_id`: Foreign key referencing the `id` column in the related model (e.g., `comments` table).
   - `commentable_type`: String column storing the class name of the related model (`App\Models\Comment`), indicating the type of the related model.

**Laravel Eloquent Setup:**

1. **Post Model:**
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->morphMany('App\Models\Comment', 'commentable');
    }
}
```

2. **Comment Model:**
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Comment extends Model
{
    public function commentable()
    {
        return $this->morphTo();
    }

    public function replies()
    {
        return $this->morphMany('App\Models\Comment', 'commentable');
    }

    public function nestedReplies()
    {
        return $this->hasMany('App\Models\Comment', 'parent_id');
    }
}
```

3. **Reply (Nested Comment) Model (Same as Comment Model):**
```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Comment extends Model
{
    public function commentable()
    {
        return $this->morphTo();
    }

    public function replies()
    {
        return $this->morphMany('App\Models\Comment', 'commentable');
    }
}
```

With this setup:

- Each post can have multiple comments, and each comment can have multiple replies (nested comments).
- The `commentable_id` and `commentable_type` columns in the `comments` and `replies` tables will indicate which post or comment they belong to, forming the polymorphic relationship.

You can now access comments and replies for a post as follows:

```php
$post = App\Models\Post::find($postId);
$comments = $post->comments;

foreach ($comments as $comment) {
    $replies = $comment->replies;
    // Process replies for each comment

    foreach ($replies as $reply) {
       $nestedReplies = $reply->nestedReplies;
       // Process nested replies for each reply
    }
}
```

This setup allows for a flexible association between posts, comments, and their replies through a polymorphic relationship, providing versatility and maintainability in your Laravel application.
