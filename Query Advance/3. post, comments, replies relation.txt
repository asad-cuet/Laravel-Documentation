If you have a `parent_id` column in the `comments` table to represent the relationship between a comment and its parent comment (reply), 
you can establish a hierarchical structure for comments, allowing for nested replies. Here's how you can set up the relationships:

1. **One-to-Many Relationship between Posts and Comments:**
   - Each post can have multiple comments.
   - Define this relationship in the `Post` model.
   - Each comment belongs to a single post.
   - Define this relationship in the `Comment` model.

2. **Self-Referencing One-to-Many Relationship for Comments:**
   - Each comment can have multiple replies (child comments).
   - Define a self-referencing one-to-many relationship in the `Comment` model, using the `parent_id` column to reference the ID of the parent comment.
   - Each reply belongs to a single parent comment.

Here's how you can set up these relationships in Laravel:

**Post Model:**
```php
class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany('App\Models\Comment');
    }
}
```

**Comment Model:**
```php
class Comment extends Model
{
    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo('App\Models\Post');
    }

    public function replies()
    {
        return $this->hasMany('App\Models\Comment', 'parent_id');
    }

    public function parent()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo('App\Models\Comment', 'parent_id');
    }
}
```

With this setup, you can access comments and their replies as follows:

- To retrieve all comments for a post:
  ```php
  $post = App\Models\Post::find($postId);
  $comments = $post->comments;
  ```

- To retrieve all replies for a comment:
  ```php
  $comment = App\Models\Comment::find($commentId);
  $replies = $comment->replies;
  ```

- To retrieve the parent comment for a reply:
  ```php
  $reply = App\Models\Comment::find($replyId);
  $parentComment = $reply->parent;
  ```

This setup allows for a hierarchical structure of comments where each comment can have multiple replies, creating a tree-like structure for discussions on posts.
