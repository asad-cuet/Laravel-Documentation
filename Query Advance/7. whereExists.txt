whereExists()
Allows you to select only rows that, when passed into a provided subquery,
return at least one row. Imagine you only want to get those users who have
left at least one comment:
$commenters = DB::table('users')
->whereExists(function ($query) {
$query->select('id')
->from('comments')
->whereRaw('comments.user_id =
users.id');
})
->get();
